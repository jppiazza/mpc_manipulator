# mpc_manipulator

To run, do the following:

1. Download the repository.
2. Change any parameters or the goal configurations in the main.m file.
3. Run the topmost section of main.m to run the controllers. Results will be saved in a 'results' folder.
4. Run the middle section of main.m to plot the results.
5. Run the bottom section of main.m to visualize the manipulator trajectories. This requires installation of Peter Corke's Robotics Toolbox, which is open source.
