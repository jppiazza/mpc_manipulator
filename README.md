# mpc_manipulator

To run, do the following:

1. Download the repository and create a folder called 'results' in the same directory as the code.
2. Change any parameters or the goal configurations in the main.m file.
3. Run the topmost section of the main.m file to run the controllers.
4. Run the middle section to plot the results.
5. Run the bottom section to visualize the manipulator trajectories. This requires installation of Peter Corke's Robotics Toolbox, which is open source.
